## ArmA 3

>Ops are Sundays 4:00PM Pacific/5:00PM Mountain/ 6:00PM Central/ 7:00PM Eastern

We are a casual ArmA 3 group - while we expect players to follow orders - we do not have mandatory training or ranks within our organization.

The ruleset is pretty small - 

1. Follow orders of whoever happens to be leading
2. Be respectful to one another

While training for special roles is not mandatory, the leader of the op may decide to put players that are more experienced in roles such as Armor, Pilot or other specialty roles.

If you have interest in specialty roles or more training just ask on the ArmA 3 chat in Discord.

### Ace Medical

We use a light version of Ace Medical:

- Bandages fix one wound
- Blood or Saline is required when someone has lost blood
- Tourniquets stop bleeding on limbs
- CPR is required to start someone's heart
- Epinephrine is used to wake someone after they have a heart beat
- Morphine can get rid of pain effects, but those subside after awhile without morphine
- Bleed out timer is roughly 5 minutes, with additional or less time depending on severity of wounds
- PAK's are not required
- All players can give blood

### Ear Plugs & Entrenching Tools

You should always have earplugs in a loadout and use them - the Ace Self Interact.

Entrenching tools are useful for digging fortifications - you should carry one whenever possible.

### DLC

We often use DLC content in our missions. In order to be able to participate on most ops, we recommend having ArmA 3 Apex Edition and ArmA 3 Contact DLC. This will give you access to most equipment in game, and more importantly to Tanoa and Livonia which future ops are scheduled to be on.

If you do not own Contact, you will not be able to participate in Ops based on Livonia.

If you do not own Apex Edition, you will not be able to participate in Ops based on Tanoa.

DLC often goes on sale - so if budget is a concern keep an eye out on the DLC prices.

### Task Force Radio

We use `Task Force Radio` or `TFAR` during our ops to simulate realistic comms during our ops.

To install:

1. Navigate to your `Steamapps/Common` folder.

2. Navigate to `Arma 3` -> `!Workshop` -> `@Task Force Arrowhead Radio (BETA!!!)` folder.

3. Run the TeamSpeak Plugin Installer in the `@Task Force Arrowhead Radio (BETA!!!)\teamspeak` folder

4. Restart TeamSpeak

6. Disable the old TFAR Plugin if it is enabled.

### Mods How & How To Install

#### Downloading and Installing the Modlist
We use several modlists depending on the mission set and Zeus.

1. Right Click the Desired Modlist and click `Save As`, change the file type to `All Files`, and add `.html` to the end of the filename if it is not there already.

2. Open the ArmA 3 Launcher and select the Mod tab on the left side

3. Click the drop down arrow on the top right where it says `PRESET Unsaved Preset`

4. At the bottom of the drop down menu, click `Import` and select the `HTML` that you downloaded

At this point, ArmA 3 will begin to download the Workshop Content.

> Important: Some modlists may be very large and can take a long time to download. Ensure you have enough disk space for the mods.

#### Modlists

[Current Modern Modlist for users Without SOG DLC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reapertrx/mercgg-arma/main/modlists/merc_ctf_1_0_0_nspf.html)
### ArmA 3 Unit

For us to get a sense of active players, as well as for you to get a shiny MERC patch for your shoulder, apply for our unit [here](https://units.arma3.com/unit/ps2mercs)

Once you are added to the unit, you can select the unit in your launcher to display your patch.

### MERC Settings / Keybinds / Loadouts

**Recommended for New Players**

The two profile files in the [keybinds folder](https://github.com/reapertrx/mercgg-arma/tree/main/keybinds) contain basic graphic configurations, keybinds, and loadouts that are useful for new players to get into the game. These files will need to be downloaded and renamed to your current profile name.

1. Make sure the game and launcher is closed.
2. Find your Profiles folder, for myself on Windows 8.1, this is in my Documents folder, e.g., “C:\Users\Lepalose\Documents\Arma 3 – Other Profiles\Lepalose”.
3. Save your current profile files!  I renamed these to “Lepalose – Orig.Arma3Profile” and “Lepalose – Orig.vars.Arma3Profile“
4. Copy your downloaded MERCLK.Arma3Profile and MERCLK1.vars.Arma3Profile  to your Arma 3 Profile folder.
5. Duplicate the MERCLK files and rename the copies to your profile name, e.g., MERCLK – Copy.Arma3Profile –> Lepalose.Arma3Profile  and MERCLK.vars – Copy.Arma3Profile –> Lepalose.vars.Arma3Profile

>Important:

- Check for ArmA keybind conflicts with your TeamSpeak Push To Talk
- Adjust audio volumes! Options -> Audio
- Adjust gamma via Options -> Video -> Display and/or change video options as necessary.

#### MERC Equipment Loadouts

The text file in the [keybinds folder](https://github.com/reapertrx/mercgg-arma/tree/main/keybinds) contains the basic and vanilla-friendly loadouts for MERC. If you installed the profiles above, than these are already installed. If you have not, you can cut and copy the individual loadouts as desired from the text file. Make sure to download the file!

1. Open the text file and locate a desired loadout (e.g., “Light AT”)
2. Select from the start of title to the start of the next title
3. Copy this text.
4. Start Arma 3, or if it is already open, go to the Main Menu screen -> Tutorials -> Virtual Arsenal
5. On the Virtual Arsenal, click Import
6. Make any fine adjustments you want, and then Save
