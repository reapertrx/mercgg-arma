## ArmA 3

>Ops are Sundays 4:00PM Pacific/5:00PM Mountain/ 6:00PM Central/ 7:00PM Eastern

### DLC

It is recommended to have at least ArmA 3 Apex Edition to be able to participate in most Ops. Unfortunately, if you are missing DLC and mission creators use content from that DLC, the server will not let you in.

Some content is unlocked with the ArmA 3 Contact DLC that will be featured in upcoming ops.

ArmA 3 DLC regularly goes on sale - keep an eye out for discounted DLC.

### Task Force Radio

We use `Task Force Radio` or `TFAR` during our ops to simulate realistic comms during our ops.

Download TFAR from [here](https://github.com/michail-nikolaev/task-force-arma-3-radio/releases/download/0.9.12/0.9.12.zip).

To install:

1. Unzip the TFAR download

2. Copy the `@task_force_radio` folder to `...\steamapps\common\arma3`

3. Run the TeamSpeak Plugin Installer in the `@task_force_radio\teamspeak` folder

4. Restart TeamSpeak

### Mods How & How To Install

#### Downloading and Installing the Modlist
We use several modlists depending on the mission set and Zeus.

1. Right Click the Desired Modlist and click `Save As`, change the file type to `All Files`, and add `.html` to the end of the filename if it is not there already.

2. Open the ArmA 3 Launcher and select the Mod tab on the left side

3. Click the drop down arrow on the top right where it says `PRESET Unsaved Preset`

4. At the bottom of the drop down menu, click `Import` and select the `HTML` that you downloaded

At this point, ArmA 3 will begin to download the Workshop Content.

> Important: Some modlists may be very large and can take a long time to download. Ensure you have enough disk space for the mods.

### ArmA 3 Unit

For us to get a sense of active players, as well as for you to get a shiny MERC patch for your shoulder, apply for our unit [here](https://units.arma3.com/unit/ps2mercs)

Once you are added to the unit, you can select the unit in your launcher to display your patch.

### MERC COMBINED SETTINGS / KEYBINDS / LOADOUTS

> Recommended for New Players

You may download the files from the keybinds folder that contain basic graphic configurations, keybinds, and loadouts that are useful for new players to get into the game. These files will need to be downloaded and renamed to your current profile name.

1. Make sure the game and launcher is closed.
2. Find your Profiles folder, for myself on Windows 8.1, this is in my Documents folder, i.e., “C:\Users\Lepalose\Documents\Arma 3 – Other Profiles\Lepalose”.
3. Save your current profile files!  I renamed these to “Lepalose – 5. Orig.Arma3Profile” and “Lepalose – Orig.vars.Arma3Profile“
4. Copy your downloaded MERCLK.Arma3Profile and MERCLK1.vars.Arma3Profile to your Arma 3 Profile folder.
5. Duplicate the MERCLK files and rename the copies to your profile name, i.e., MERCLK – Copy.Arma3Profile –> Lepalose.Arma3Profile  and MERCLK.vars – Copy.Arma3Profile –> Lepalose.vars.Arma3Profile

> Notes

- CHECK FOR ANY ARMA 3 KEYBIND CONFLICTS WITH YOUR TEAMSPEAK PUSH-TO-TALK KEY BINDING
- Adjust audio volumes! Options -> Audio
- Adjust gamma via Options -> Video -> Display and/or change video options as necessary.
