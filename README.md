## ArmA 3

### Task Force Radio

We use `Task Force Radio` or `TFAR` during our ops to simulate realistic comms during our ops.

Download TFAR from [here](https://github.com/michail-nikolaev/task-force-arma-3-radio/releases/download/0.9.12/0.9.12.zip).

To install:

1. Unzip the TFAR download

2. Copy the `@task_force_radio` folder to `...\steamapps\common\arma3`

3. Run the TeamSpeak Plugin Installer in the `@task_force_radio\teamspeak` folder

4. Restart TeamSpeak

### Mods How & How To Install

#### Downloading and Installing the Modlist
We use several modlists depending on the mission set and Zeus.

1. Right Click the Desired Modlist and click `Save As`, change the file type to `All Files`, and add `.html` to the end of the filename if it is not there already.

2. Open the ArmA 3 Launcher and select the Mod tab on the left side

3. Click the drop down arrow on the top right where it says `PRESET Unsaved Preset`

4. At the bottom of the drop down menu, click `Import` and select the `HTML` that you downloaded

At this point, ArmA 3 will begin to download the Workshop Content.

> Important: Some modlists may be very large and can take a long time to download. Ensure you have enough disk space for the mods.
